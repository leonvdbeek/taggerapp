## TaggerApp

Demo available at: https://heliostagger.herokuapp.com (Might take some time to spin up)

This is a simple web app made for fun that uses a RestDB.io database to save 'Tags'.

The idea is that a person can tag a spot they are in right now using this web app. By clicking the button on the bottom a dialog comes up in which the user can enter a title, description and upload a photo to go along with the tag.

Only after clicking the save button the image will be uploaded and the tag posted to the database.

To see already placed tags, simple press on the markers on the map.

Technologies used:
- React
- Geolocation from browser
- Google Maps JS
- Restdb.io API for Tags and images
- Heroku for free hosting
